### Inclusion/Exclusion

Criteria to exclude students who most likely took a scored exam:

-   Any PhD students (n = 2)

-   Any 5th year program students (n = 19)

-   M4 students at Vanderbilt (n = 5)

-   Students who did not complete either Step survey (n = 2)

-   Students who specifically stated they took a scored Step 1 (n=1)

Based on our criteria we would exclude record IDs:

-   VUSM: 23, 26, 39, 40, 54, 3, 8, 12, 49, 60, 62, 64

-   HMS: 1, 21, 28, 30, 34, 37, 39, 41, 44, 47, 49, 61

-   UVA: 33, 47, 80, 81, 83

There were `r length(intersect(all_survey_ids, collaborator_survey_ids))` participants after the the clients did data exclusion by hand, as compared to the total survey size which was `r length(step1_complete$uniqueID)` unique individuals included in the step 1 data.

These are the record IDs that were excluded by the collaborator: `r setdiff(all_survey_ids, collaborator_survey_ids)`.

For our analysis, I originally included everyone from the 3 school specific data sets. Then, we flagged individuals to remove and I remade the source data set. These are the records IDs that we decided to exclude:

-   VU record ids: 23, 26, 39, 40, 54, 3, 8, 12, 49, 60, 62, 64

-   HMS record ids: 1, 21, 28, 30, 34, 37, 39, 41, 44, 47, 49, 61

-   UVA record ids: 33, 47, 80, 81, 83

Below are tables for Step 1 and Step 2 response inclusion by school:

```{r}
kable(table(step1_complete$schoolid), caption = "Number of Step 1 responses included by school")

kable(table(step2_complete$schoolid), caption = "Number of Step 2 responses included by school")
```

Notice that unfortunately for Step 2 analysis, we had to drop `r nrow(drop_these_with_no_outcome)` individuals who did not report a step 2 score. These raw counts and frequencies of people who did not give a step 2 score (and are therefor not eligible for analysis) are listed by institution below.

```{r}
# describing the missingness
kable(table(drop_these_with_no_outcome$schoolid), caption = "Number of missing Step 2 scores by institution")
num <- as.vector(table(drop_these_with_no_outcome$schoolid))
denom <- as.vector(table(step2_complete$schoolid))
nonresponse_freq <- setNames(c(round(num/denom, 3)), c(names(table(step2_complete$schoolid))))
kable(nonresponse_freq, caption = "frequency of missing step 2 scores by instition")
```

We also find it helpful to visually profile the missingness in this graphic below. Some of this missingness is due to questions being hierarchical.

```{r}
######### visually profile missing responses
p1 <- visdat::vis_miss(step1_complete)
p2 <- visdat::vis_miss(step2_complete)

title_gg <- ggdraw() + draw_label("Response missingness for pooled survey results across exam order")
gridded <- plot_grid(p1, p2, label_size = 12, ncol = 2, align = "hv", label_x = 0.5,
          labels = c("Step 1","Step 2"))
plot_grid(title_gg, gridded, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(0.1, 0.9))
```

# Analysis

Note, we plan to use the robust/sandwich variance estimator for regression models. One inclusion criteria is that the outcome variable ("Y") must be available for a subject to be included in the analysis question (ie. if they did not report a step 2 score, we won't perform relevant step 2 analysis on them).

::: panel-tabset
## Q1 Does order have an impact on Step 2 scores?

We cannot analyze Step 1 since all survey responses reported passing For Step 2 scores, I will perform a linear regression with:

-   Y = Step 2 score
-   X = factor ( 1 = "step 1 first", 2 = "step 2 first", 3 = "only step 1", 4 = "only step 2")
-   Z = school (need to adjust for this)

```{r exam_order_analysis}
step2_complete[ ,"order_factor"]  <- factor(step2_complete$exam_order, levels = c(1,2, 3, 4), labels = c("step 1 first", "step 2 first", "only step 1", "only step 2"))

step2_complete[ ,"which_exam_first"] <- ifelse(step2_complete$order_factor == "step 1 first" | step2_complete$order_factor == "only step 1", 1, 2)

step2_complete[ ,"school_factor"]   <- factor(step2_complete$schoolid, labels = c("HMS", "UVA", "VUMS"))

table(step2_complete$order_factor)
table(step2_complete$which_exam_first)

exam_order_mod <- lm(formula = score_step2 ~ which_exam_first + school_factor, data = step2_complete)
sandwich(exam_order_mod) #this gives the sandwich variance
summary(exam_order_mod) #model summary for reporting
```

Based on the model output (p values), there doesn't appear to be any signifigant associations between exam order and the score for Step 2. Since the $R^2$ value is essentially 0, I conclude that there was no effect of exam order on step 2 scores.

## Q2 What factors affect Step 2 score?

Again, we cannot analyze Step 1 scores since all respondents reported passing.

Based on our SAP, if there are any covariates with more than 30% of responses missing, we will drop that variable or populate it with 0, depending on context. For example, the percent of Amboss questions completed will be filled with 0 for people who didn't answer that they used Amboss since it seems safe to assume they didn't complete any of the Amboss questions. For people who did select that they used Amboss but didn't answer a percentage will be treated as missing

If less than 30% are missing, I may consider performing bootstrap sampling of known values to replace missing values.

After accounting for missingness, I will assess for co-linearity of the predictors (ie. correlation) using VIF. If there is high co-linearity, we will use LASSO to perform variable selection. If there is no evidence of concerning levels of colinearity, I will proceed with linear regression.

```{r data_profile_and_pairs_plots}
#| warning: false

Multiple linear regression with:

-   Y = Step 2 score (from "What was your 3-digit score on the official Step 2 exam?")

-   X1 = % UWorld (recoded from "Approximately what % of UWorld did you complete during your protected study period for step 2?")

-   X2 = % Amboss (recoded from "Approximately what % of the Amboss question bank did you complete during your Step 2 protected study period?")

-   X3 = length study (factor from "How long did you study for Step 2 during a protected study period?")

-   X4 = # of practice tests (recoded from a text answer from "How many total practice tests did you take before Step 2?")

-   X5 = full test day (yes/no code as binary from "Did you simulate a full Step 2 test day experience, e.g. 8 blocks of 40 UWorld questions or 2 of the 4-section practice tests?")

-   X6 = final practice score (What was your 3 digit score on the final practice test you took before the Step 2 exam?)

-   Z = School (need to adjust for this in order to remove any influence)

Careful to note that not all cases are complete - for example there are 399 responses in the complete step 2 dataset, of which for the number of practice tests taken, 108 are missing and 291 have a response recorded.

Below I report the model results, sandwich variance, and VIF for step 2 scores model. After that, I show descriptive statistics for predictors and the outcome that was included in the model.

```{r}
mod_step2_scores <- lm(score_step2 ~ uworld_clean + amboss_clean + length_step2 + simulate_full_practice + practice_score_step2 + number_of_practice_tests + school_factor, data = step2_complete) 
summary(mod_step2_scores)
sandwich(mod_step2_scores)
vif(mod_step2_scores)

mod_step2_scores %>% tbl_regression() #this makes a cleaner looking summary table
```

Trying the model with imputation, but there is an issue right now with just imputing one value instead of randomly sampling...

::: callout-note
imputation needs to be fixed before interpreting this model! see the snippet of the updated data showing this issue

## Q3 What is associated (in this data) with pushing back a Step 1 exam date?

Here, I will perform logistic regression with

Y = yes or no (1 = yes, 2 = no for "push_step1")

There may not be sufficient data on this since only 20 people responded that they decided to push back Step 1. The factors that were measured are:

-   push remember step1 (1 = I only remember the form name, 2 = I only remember the score, 3 = I remember the form name and the score, 4 = I don't remember either) - we decided not to include this variable (can change later if desired)

-   push score only step 1 (1 = NBME, 2 = Uworld)

-   push practice test step 1 ( 1 - 8 listing various exams)

-   push nbme practice score (from 0 to 100%)

-   push uw practice score (from 180 to 300)

Listing variables by name and if I have included them:

-   "push_step1_1" yes

-   "push_remember_step1_1" not included b/c a precursor question

-   "push_score_only_step1_1" not currently included but could be

-   "push_practice_test_step1_1" yes

-   "push_nbme_practice_score_step1_1" yes

-   "push_uw_practice_score_step1_1" yes

```{r}
step1_complete$push_step1 <- ifelse(step1_complete$push_step1 == 2 | is.na(step1_complete$push_step1) ==TRUE, 2, 1) #recording the NA's to be "No" (they did not push back step 1)
step1_complete$push_step1_label <- factor(step1_complete$push_step1, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Yes", "No")) #making a nice descriptive label

did_push_df <- step1_complete %>% filter(push_step1_label == "Yes")
dat %>% filter(!is.na(push_remember_step1_1))

step1_complete$push_practice_test_step1 <- factor(step1_complete$push_practice_test_step1, levels = c(1:8), labels = c("NBME 25", "NBME 26", "NBME 27", "NBME 28", "NBME 29", "NBME 30", "UWorld 1", "UWorld 2"))

units(step1_complete$push_uw_practice_score_step1) <- "score units"
units(step1_complete$push_nbme_practice_score_step1) <- "percent"
label(step1_complete$push_practice_test_step1) <- "exam that triggered pushing back"
label(step1_complete$push_nbme_practice_score_step1) <- "NBME P(passing) that triggered pushing back"
label(step1_complete$push_uw_practice_score_step1) <- "3 digit UWorld score that triggered pushing back"
caption <- "Description of indiviuals that pushed back Step 1"
table1(~ push_practice_test_step1 + push_uw_practice_score_step1 + push_nbme_practice_score_step1 |push_step1_label, data=step1_complete, topclass="Rtable1-zebra")
```

## Descriptive Statistics (still in progress)

Descriptive statistics will be reported in total and not by school (as requested by the collaborators).

-   Question banks
      -   % UWorld for step 1 and 2
      -   % Amboss for step 1 and 2

-   length of study for step 1 and step 2 (barplot with frequency table)
-   # of practice tests (recoded from a text answer from "How many total practice tests did you take before Step 2?")
-   full test day as factor from "Did you simulate a full Step 2 test day experience, e.g. 8 blocks of 40 UWorld questions or 2 of the 4-section practice tests?" "full_practice_test"

-   histogram of Step 2 scores
-   what resources are most widely used barplot

-   number of practice tests histogram (among the people who answered the question)
-   summarize comments for other_resources, other_step, changes_step

Practice Scores for Step 1 and Step 2
-   probability of passing for step 1
  -   final_nbme_practice_score_step1 is a percent from 0 to 100
  -   final_uw_practice_score_step1 is a 3 digit UWorld score for step 1
-   final practice score for step 2 (3 digit score)

looking at the data dictionary, we are given final_nbme_practice _score_step1 and final_uw_practice_s core_step1 which are two different covariates which are ONLY in Step 1.

Since everyone passed step 1, I did not run a regression model that included these covariates. Instead, I will make a plot to show this in descriptive data.

These specific questions were not included for step 2, instead there is a question for practice_score_step2, which I do include in the model for step 2 score predictors above.
